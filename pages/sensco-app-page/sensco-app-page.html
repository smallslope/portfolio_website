            <p slot="description">
                The Sensco app is an e-commerce app for a medium sized supermarket chain. The app has two core functions; to allow users to order their groceries online and to assist customer’s shopping in store through features like an interactive store map, smart shopping list and stock availability.I designed this app as part of Google’s UX Design Certificate.             </p>

                I kickstarted the project by conducting user interviews to find out people’s shopping habits and to understand any frustrations they encounter. As it was my first time conducting user interviews, I recruited my friends and family and interviewed four participants. 
                <br><br>
                I asked them the following questions:

                The research was useful as it allowed me to empathise with various users and get a feel for how different people go about doing their shopping. From this data I created user personas to represent different user segments.

The ideas were based on the problem and hypothesis statements.  Rapidly sketching out ideas allowed me generate loads of ideas without a filter and while some of the ideas were crazy there were some good ideas in there too.

                This project was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with design systems. Towards the end of the project I started reading a book called “Laying the Foundations” by Andrew Couldwell which opened my eyes up to the benefits of creating Design systems and how to go about creating them and maintaining them. The design system I created isn’t the most comprehensive but it served its purposes in making the designs for the app consistent and scalable.

                I learned a lot of valuable lessons from this project. I won’t outline them all as I don’t want to bore you to death so below I have listed three key lessons I have learned:

                <br><br>
                While I did interview a wide demographic of people albeit only four of them none of them used grocery shopping apps much so even though I got some valuable insights into people’s shopping habits I could have done with more insights into people who use grocery apps.

                <br><br>
                Throughout the project I kept struggling to name things so I started looking into naming conventions and best practices and tried to stick with one (Although I kept changing my mind about which ones to use...) I haven’t completely mastered the art of naming conventions yet but I am getting there...

                The sooner you think about these things the more efficiently you can design things and the more organised you can be about it.
