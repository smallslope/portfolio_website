                The Sensco app is an e-commerce app for a medium sized supermarket chain. The app has two core functions; to allow users to order their groceries online and to assist customer’s shopping in store through features like an interactive store map, smart shopping list and stock availability.

                I kickstarted the project by conducting user interviews to find out people’s shopping habits and to understand any frustrations they encounter. As it was my first time conducting user interviews, I recruited my friends and family and interviewed four participants. 
                <br><br>

                Julie is a busy project manager who wants to do her grocery shopping efficiently because she wants to maximise her free time at home. 
                <br>
                If Julie uses the supermarket’s app she can write a shopping list and plan an efficient route through the supermarket which will save her time.
